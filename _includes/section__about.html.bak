      </p>

      <p>Currently I'm working primarily as a Product Designer and UX consultant, helping companies get started online, or improving their existing apps and websites. But have worked across the design spectrum in both print and digital mediums.</p>
      <p>I'm currently available for select freelance projects, I'd love to hear more about your company and what you're looking to build - send me an email!</p>
