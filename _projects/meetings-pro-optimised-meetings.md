**An award winning meetings management tool, supporting a strategic and simple process to increase policy compliance, identify trends and improve value and efficiency.**

### Scope

Agito, then Capita Travel & Events, is a company that serves as a corporate travel agency but with a refreshing approach; they focus on the traveller. A key focus for them and their market differentiator is that rather than aiming for the cheapest option for the company, they'd prioritise the wellbeing of the traveller. They aim to reduce unneeded travel, minimise time spent travelling and generally improve efficiencies all round. They were pushing remote meetings as the optimal choice even before the COVID pandemic. 

The company was focussing on meetings for the coming year, and wanted to offer an one-stop shop for bookers to arrange meetings, travel and accomodation for groups of delegates. I worked with the company to bring their disparate offerings which had largely been acquired through acquisition, into a cohesive user experience while also ensuring the travellers needs were prioritised. 

### Approach
My initial approach here was to arrange user interviews, I met with groups of external meeting bookers, the internal venue finding teams as well as managers or team leads who organised meetings within their teams. 

These initial interviews identified a number of areas where users had issues with their available tooling. 
- Often they weren't able to check internal space for meetings either at all, or without being able to see availability. 
- If they were able to book externally they usually had to request space from a particular staff member, adding more layers and redundant effort to the process. 
- Policies and processes were often hidden away in documentation and easily forgotten. This often led to booking being rejected. 
- Bookers would have to communicate these plans manually to all invities.
- There was no oversight for managers. 

With these finding in mind, along with the inhouse behaviourial psychologist we prioritised some key functionality for the platform:
- Policy integration, users should only be able to book items that fall within their policy and allowances. 
- Take into account the travel time for all delegates and prioritise options which minimise travel for everyone.
- Live data and availability. Where possible show the rates and availability of venues and delgates. 
- Suggest savings that can be made. 
- Prioritise interally owned spaces over external venues. 
- Book instantly and online. 
- Empower users to self manage.

With these goals in mind, I mapped the proposed user flow through the application and validated this again with representatives from the initial round of user interviews. 

Once validated, I worked to produce a prototype, that would be presented to prospective customers at an upcoming trade show. This prototype allowed us to trial the proposed application with real users and gather feedback without the high overheads of developing a fully fleshed out solution. Feedback from this stage was then incorperated into the prototype, which continued to be tested internally.

> “Meetingspro® has delivered process efficiencies when booking smaller meetings and achieved an 8% reduction in overall spend.”

This working version was then tested with live customers and we saw a very positive reception:
- Average adoption rate of 86%
- Reduction is average cost-per-delegate
- Reduction in cost-per-booking
- Reduction in external venue spend

> “Meetingspro® has made a huge increase in time efficiency, and when used correctly makes significant cost savings.”
