**After nearly 15 tmgroup’s flagship product needed some improvments. Having grown organically over that time, technology had changed, and it was becoming difficult to extend or maintain.**

With such a long lifespan, tmconvey had an established and dedicated user base that had found their own work-arounds for areas of the system which weren’t intuitive or where technology had changed. The system was functional, but un-intuitive and more than a little intimidating for new users.

### Scope

The relaunch was an extremely ambitious project involving extremely tight project deadlines, multiple stakeholders, several external integrations and a still-live legacy system that was being quickly phased out. 

In addition to acting as UX lead on the project, I worked to manage expectation and share a singular vision for what the platform could and should be – creating a solid foundation for the future. The project ran so that new prototypes and features would be released on a rolling 2 week basis (working alongside an agile development team). This meant we could quickly validate the team’s direction.

### Approach
My approach started with user interviews. From these interviews we identified key pain points in the process and moved to address these with wireframes which were then tested with the same users. Following success here, I then cast a wider net, meeting more users to ensure they addressed the issues.

Once the concepts were proven with the users, we stepped up to prototype stage. As this we such a wide-reaching project, these prototypes took many forms from clickable Adobe XD mockups, HTML/JS or more extensive angular/.net microsites created alongside development resource.

> “Following launch, with opt-in functionality we saw a 90% adoption of the new interface and workflow within the first working week.”


### Selected Highlights

##### An easily managed case load

From the interviews I aimed to understand how the users worked, regardless of the system employed. One of the early findings was the often users are working on a group of cases, much of their work is reactive based on information received – this became an early target of the team’s efforts. 

We prototyped a switch from a traditional ‘list’ of cases to a paradigm more in keeping with established email clients, allowing the users to quickly click (or navigate using the keyboard) down a list of their cases, seeing a summary of new activity and general progress at a glance. 

> “We like the new tmconvey platform and find it very easy to use. It is colourful and easy to find your way around. ”

##### Easy to read case summaries - that you don't need a law degree to understand

The legal secretaries using tmconvey often have to get signed approval before incurring charges on client cases, previously this required them to print out a lengthy and complicated document, that only showed costs before presenting it to the client for approval. 

I redesigned the new look summary to include all the case information, along with the associated costs in a simple, familiar format that clients could easily interpret and approve; saving valuable time for the users and stress for the clients. 

##### Form pre-population and validation
We often already had information stored on the case. Where this information exists we pre-populate it in any forms or submissions else where in the system. Not only does this save huge amounts of time for users, it also eliminates human error due to re-keying - something especially important due to the important legal nature of these submissions.
