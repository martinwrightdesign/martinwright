**Designed for a leading business travel company this app combines the traveller’s complete trip in one place — giving them their complete itinerary and all the information they need, when they need it.**

### Scope

The business travel company was going through a digital transformation, the industry was modernising with e-tickets and apps and they were looking to bring together the separate business arms,  which had recently completed APIs. The company was also seeking to differentiate itself with a renewed focus on not just being the cheapest, but on doing the best for their travellers 

A key pain point identified often in their feedback was was disparate collection of email booking confirmations, e-tickets and phone numbers a business traveller needs to manage on a typical overnight trip - this is the key focus of the app - to make this routine travel as painless as possible and reinforce the company’s aim of putting the traveler first. 

### Approach
The company wanted to produce an app for its customers, but move quickly towards a prototype to show at an industry trade show. 

With a clear aim and armed with statistics on the companies travellers I identified three main types of travellers: 

- **Frequent travellers**, these are away multiple times a week, have a good understanding of travel networks they use and often visit many different sites.
- **Regular travellers**, these will travel less often, and usually to one or two destinations, often by the same route and staying in the same hotels.
- **Infrequent travellers**, these only travel rarely, perhaps for annual industry events or one off visits. They’re unsure of the travel networks and unfamiliar with the hotels they might stay at.

Having identified these personas I sourced an example user from each and arranged interviews. 

The interviews firstly asked the users to talk about their experiences travelling - what were their worries the night before, on the day of, how did they prepare and how was their last experience and why. Secondly I asked the users to follow through an example trip itinerary and perform card sorting exercises at key points to establish the information the traveller requires then, and what they see as important. 

With the output from these interviews I was able to map these concerns and key information to a user flow, before moving onto a wire framing stage.

I sought to create a simple linear timeline that would surface the relevant information for the customer based on information the app can gather from their device and apis such as; Location, Time and Delays identified on their route. 

Unfortunately I wasn’t able to test the wireframes with all of the users interviewed, but was able to source another user from within the travel company. 

The wireframes were well received and I moved onto discussions with the development resource about the approach to creating the prototype to be shown at the industry show. Due to customer commitments however, the development resource wasn’t available for more than consultation and we had to look for alternatives.

With time running out, the decision was made to work with an XD prototype and mobile devices preloaded with it. The prototype would be available on larger screens at customer breakout pods and on the preloaded mobile devices with staff manning the stand. 

This meant the prototype would have to be scaled back from the original vision, we wouldn’t be able to push real time updates for example and would have to rely on a linear narrative supported by the staff on the stand. 

### Lessons Learned

The prototype was a success at the show and well received all round, that being said though the project as a whole was not without its issues. 

Losing one of the interviewees threw a bit of a spanner in the works, fortunately quickly rectified and in hindsight the project would have benefited from using some of the internal users throughout and not just as stand ins. This highlights an issue with relying on such a small sample size, ideally we would have been able to include more customers but it was ultimately an issue of the tight deadline. If I were to approach the project again, I would aim to get a broader sample, possibly by including a secondary online survey focussing on the card sorting element of the interview. 

Finally the project was a victim of its own ambition. The wider goal is certainly feasible for an end product, but was over reaching for the industry show, especially with the loss of development resources. Approaching the project again, I would look to identify an MVP for the show and then look to use that as an additional testing resource to inform the follow on development.
