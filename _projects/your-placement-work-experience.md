**Founded with two ex-colleagues, I built a platform to match school students with available work experience placements in a way that mimicked the real job hunt process.**

### The problem to solve
One of the biggest challenges for schools offering work experience placements, is identifying employers who are able to offer them for their student group. The number of employers offering Placements has been continuing to decrease and the amount of time schools are having to spend locating placements was significantly increasing. This was time and resource being taken from an ever decreasing school budget and was resulting in schools either reducing or stopping work experience placements all together.

Employers we spoke to were often contacted by multiple schools all seeking the meagre numbers of placements, those employers that weren't already offering placement but could didn't know what their obligations were. 

This is the challenge I'd hoped to solve along with two ex-colleagues. YourPlacement was a way to streamline the work experience process, making it much simpler and quicker for both employers and schools to work together to offer the number and quality of placements required to fulfil the demand.

#### The solution
Design a site to remove the barriers which were preventing Employers from offering placements, while at the same time support schools in the arranging and management of placements to their students.

The site would enable employers to get set up quickly, ensure they had everything they required prepared to host a work experience student and act as the one medium to administer applications — no more unending phone calls. 

For schools it would drastically reduce the admin required, they could see the available placements, check that the employers are all above board and ensure all relevant policies, insurances and risk assessments were in place — no more manual site visits. The site also ensured the school was included at the heart of all interactions so they can ensure their students are safe guarded, and acting appropriately themselves. 

Finally for the students, they get an experience closer to the real job market. They search available placements that suit their interests and requirements, apply digitally with their CV, are evaluated (perhaps interviewed) and ultimately accepted or rejected.

### The not so short story.
Way back in 2016 we started talks with Swindon Council and eventually we secured a small amount of funding to run a limited trial in 2018 with selected schools and handful of companies. We worked to quickly build a rough and ready MVP of the product and deployed it in time for the school's work experience window. This school managed their placements using the first iteration of the platform and placed a number of students through it. We'd proven the concept, and the value it could add for schools. 

We'd conducted surveys with both schools and companies and the feedback was all positive! Wiltshire Council has also registered it's interest following the success of the initial trial. 

In 2019 we sought additional funding to enable a wider roll out, we pitched to several large companies, had more meetings with the councils. We progressed with a company who hoped to invest, however this ultimately fell through when it was acquired itself.

Further progress was unfortunately stalled here due to the COVID pandemic. 

##### Relaunch post Lockdown
In 2021 with the pandemic affecting (among other things!) face to face work experience, we pivoted to support virtual placements too. Partnering with a local college we hosted a library of video content on the platform, enabling students to continue some careers based learning as well as apply for 'virtual' placements through the platform too. We incorporated here, formally forming YourPlacement LTD and secured another round of funding, this time from Wiltshire Council to facilitate these changes, and then roll out for another trial. 

##### Phase two, tough decisions and a change of team. 
Outlining the requirements for phase two, there were some very tight deadlines and unfortunately the platform was still a scrappy MVP. It quickly became apparent that we'd have to do some heavy lifting to get the platform into a place to facilitate the impending trial and the roll out planned afterwards. 

At this time, our current Technical co-founder was unable to complete the work — weeks away from intended trial launch we had to part ways with a key team member! 

Thankfully after a few desperate calls we were able to find a replacement I'd worked with closely before, and a frantic period of work began.
- We completely rebuilt the platform with cloud hosting in mind
- Full rebrand for launch
- Entire UX revamp 
- New UI

##### Second trial 
2023 saw the second trial, this time with a much stronger platform. We were in a strong place with a new look and feel and a much more professional offering. Various factors worked against us however and the trial proceeded with only one school and one employer.

This was disappointing, while Zurich Insurance loved the platform we'd been let down by employer engagement from the school and their willingness to offer placements in such trying financial times. 

> "YourPlacement has been such a useful tool in helping us make our work experience offering much more manageable and the end to end process has been seamless. We love having the ability to advertise placements and knowing the students get a real flavour for what it’s like to apply for an opportunity – even having to provide a CV and cover letter! I am confident that YourPlacement will be able to help many students, teachers and employers make work experience easier to manage and co-ordinate. —  Zurich Insurance"

### Failure
While the trials proved the value of the product, unfortunately we have (as of September 2023) decided to call it a day. We were able to secure funding for another wider trial, however we've not been able to secure a means for the platform to sustain itself long term. 

The original intention had been for schools to pay a nominal per-student fee in order to use the platform. However with tighter and tighter budgets, work experience suffers and a significant number of schools are unable to afford even this nominal fee. 

**Fundamentally I'm truly proud of the platform we built, I believe it could add real value to students and employers alike.**

This just isn't the right time for it, with the background of the cost-of-living crisis and multiple redundancies, companies just can't commit the time to host work experience students. Similarly schools with ever tightening budgets focus on core curriculum. It is with a heavy heart we decided to pull the plug on YourPlacement.  

### Lessons learned
I have of course learnt a great deal through the Your Placement journey. 
- I've secured funding from two separate local government authorities
- Formed a company with ex colleagues 
- Pitched to a multinational conglomerate 
- Flirted with acquisition
- Had to make the hard decision to part ways with an original founder 
- Recruited a new technical cofounder!
- Rebuilt a platform in weeks from the ground up! 
- Tried, and tried again
- Realised when it's time to stop... for now.
